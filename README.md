# sales-person-recording-system
Add sales people to the roster and record the sales of the sales force.
As you add sales people, their ID and name is stored in a local .txt file
when you add a new sales figure, you input date, ID and quantity sold
  this data is written to another .txt file -- except that the ID you 
  enter is matched with the ID in the salespeeople.txt file so the date, name, quantity and total value of sales (based on predetermined celling price)
  is written to the salesfigrues.txt file
